    <p>“As I relax on the sofa and gaze 
        around a room a thought hits me: this is exactly
         the place I’ve been looking for all my life.
          A little hideaway in some sinkhole somewhere. I’d
           always thought of it as a secret, imaginary place
           , and can barely believe that it actually exists.
            I close my eyes and take a breath, and wonder o
            f it all settles over me like a gentle cloud.”
